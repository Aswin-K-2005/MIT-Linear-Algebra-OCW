# MIT-Linear-Algebra-OCW
A self studying journey to note all of the things I learned and what all I implemented it 
ðŸ§  **Personal Learning Log**

This repo is a personal archive of what I learned from [MIT OCW Linear Algebra](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/) taught by Prof. Gilbert Strang. It contains notes and Python implementations for key concepts.

> **Note**: This is not meant as a tutorial or resource for othersâ€”just a record of my own learning journey.

## Contents
- `notes/`: My personal notes (not optimized for sharing)
- `code/`: Python scripts using NumPy to reinforce concepts like matrix ops and eigenvalues

## Topics Covered
- Matrix operations and linear systems
- Vector spaces and bases
- Eigenvalues, eigenvectors
- Applications in ML: PCA basics

## Purpose
To demonstrate serious self-learning and math foundation relevant for AI/ML roles.
